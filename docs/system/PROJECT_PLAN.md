# PROJECT_PLAN: Atomic Bug Bounty Handover System

## 1. Architecture Overview
A trustless commerce system for bug bounties built on the **ERC-8183** standard. The system uses an **AI Evaluator Agent** (LangGraph) as the independent mediator to verify fixes and broker the handover of code from a Proposer to a Client.

### Core Components
- **AtomicHandover.sol**: The core smart contract managing the Job lifecycle (Open, Funded, Submitted, Completed, Rejected, Expired).
- **Evaluator Agent (LangGraph)**: An autonomous agent that clones private GitHub repos, verifies fixes, generates sanitized download package, and triggers on-chain resolution.
- **Lit Protocol**: For atomic handover of decryption keys for the fix.
- **Filecoin/IPFS**: For decentralized storage of the (encrypted) fix and evaluation reports.

## 2. Smart Contract Design (ERC-8183 Based)
The contract will implement the `IACP` (Agent Commerce Protocol) interface with a focus on modular hooks.

### State Transitions
1. **Open**: Proposer creates the Job, describing the bug and setting the price.
2. **Funded**: Client deposits the bounty (e.g., $10,000). The Proposer may also provide an optional $500 slashing fee.
3. **Submitted**: Proposer submits the (encrypted) fix hash.
4. **Completed**: Evaluator verifies the fix and releases funds to the Proposer.
5. **Rejected (Cancelled)**: Client cancels the deal (no bad faith); funds returned to Client.
6. **Rejected (Slashed)**: Client claims the Proposer's slashing fee due to bad faith; funds returned to Client + slashing fee.

### Hooks
- `beforeFund`: Verify slashing fee if applicable.
- `beforeSubmit`: Ensure the fix hash is provided.
- `afterComplete`: Trigger the Lit Protocol key handover (via events/indexers).

## 3. Evaluator Agent Design (The Integrity Bridge)
The agent is an autonomous LangGraph state machine responsible for verifying that the off-chain deliverable matches the on-chain agreement.

### Integrity-First Processing Nodes
1. **Verification Engine (zkTLS)**: 
   - Uses **vlayer** to prove the state of private GitHub repositories.
   - Generates a cryptographic proof that the specific bug-fix PR was merged.
   - Ensures the proof is generated without exposing sensitive API credentials.
2. **Security Sealing (Atomic Gate)**: 
   - Generates a local `AES-256` key for the verified codebase.
   - Stores the key in a gated vault that only releases it to the Client once the on-chain status is `Completed`.
3. **On-Chain Settlement**: 
   - Triggers `complete(jobId, proofHash)` on Base Sepolia.
   - This single action releases payment AND unlocks the atomic gate for the Client.

### Security Guarantee
The Evaluator acts as a neutral oracle. It cannot release funds without a valid zkTLS proof, and it cannot release the code until the funds are settled on-chain.

## 4. Job Creator Agent Design (The Strategic Architect)
The Creator Agent is the entry point for humans or other agents into the protocol. Its role is to design a high-integrity agreement.

### Strategic Responsibilities
1. **Requirement Extraction**: Parses natural language to extract the Job `description`, `budget`, and `provider`.
2. **Evaluator Selection**: Matches the Job's security profile with a verified Evaluator Agent (e.g., selecting the 'zkTLS-GitHub' evaluator for a codebase bug fix).
3. **Hook Orchestration**: Recommends and attaches mandatory hooks (e.g., `CollateralHook` for high-value bounties) to protect the Client.
4. **On-Chain Initialization**: Deploys the Job to the `AtomicHandover` contract and hands off control to the protocol state machine.

### Security Role
The Creator ensures that the Job is **structurally sound** before a single dollar is escrowed. It prevents "Malformed Job" attacks by validating all parameters against the EIP-8183 standard.

## 7. Technical Interface Guide (EIP-8183)
Use these exact signatures and sequences when interacting with `AtomicHandover.sol`.

### Function Signatures
- **Create**: `createJob(address provider, address evaluator, uint256 expiredAt, string description, address hook)`
- **Negotiate**: `setBudget(uint256 jobId, uint256 amount, bytes optParams)` (Callable by Client or Proposer)
- **Fund**: `fund(uint256 jobId, bytes optParams)` (Callable by Client only)
- **Submit**: `submit(uint256 jobId, bytes32 deliverable, bytes optParams)` (Callable by Proposer only)
- **Resolve (Success)**: `complete(uint256 jobId, bytes32 reason, bytes optParams)` (Callable by Evaluator only)
- **Resolve (Failure)**: `reject(uint256 jobId, bytes32 reason, bytes optParams)` (Callable by Client if Open, Evaluator if Funded/Submitted)

### Event Logic for Agents
- **Discovery**: Watch for `JobCreated` to find new tasks.
- **Trigger**: Watch for `JobFunded` to start work.
- **Evaluation**: Watch for `JobSubmitted` to start the verification engine.
- **Settlement**: Watch for `JobCompleted` or `JobRejected` to update reputation scores.

## 8. Reusability Note
This contract is a generic implementation of the **Agentic Commerce Protocol**. It is not tied to bug bounties specifically and can be reused for any trustless agent-to-agent transaction by simply passing different `description` strings and `evaluator` addresses.
