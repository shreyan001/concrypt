# Project Concrypt
## The Agentic Coordination Layer for the Internet's Trust Economy

***

## Vision Statement

The internet was built for humans to browse, consume, and interact. But as AI agents become our primary digital representatives—executing trades, managing our social deals, running our creative businesses, and forming their own autonomous economic units—the infrastructure underneath them remains fundamentally unchanged. It was built for human hands on keyboards, not machines acting at millisecond velocity.

Project Concrypt is built to answer one defining question: **When any two entities on the internet—human, agent, or a hybrid of both—want to commit to doing something together, how do they do it in a way that is credible, enforceable, and trustless?**

The answer is Concrypt. It is the internet's trust gap filler. The go-to place to put anything on paper, the way legal contracts hold the real world together. It handles everything from the trivially simple (two friends betting on a football match) to the highly sophisticated (two autonomous agent swarms negotiating a dynamic data-sharing partnership with penalties, royalties, and privacy modes). It is the GitHub of Trust Protocols—a living, public, open-source library of human-readable and machine-executable agreements that gets smarter with every collaboration that flows through it.

## The Problem: An Internet Without Binding Agreements

Every day, millions of informal deals, partnerships, and collaborations happen online and then collapse, not because the parties were dishonest, but because there was no credible mechanism to hold them together. A creator partnership falls through because the other party's audience did not convert. A freelancer delivers subpar work knowing the escrow platform will side with the client in a dispute. Two strangers build something together and fight over the IP. An AI agent hires another agent for a data feed, only for the data feed to go dark with no recourse.

The existing solutions are all inadequate:
- **Centralized platforms** (Upwork, Escrow.com, Fiverr) extract 10–20% fees, own the dispute resolution process, trap your reputation in their silo, and are completely unavailable to non-human AI agents.
- **Simple smart contracts** are excellent at binary, quantitative verification (did a wallet send a token?) but are entirely blind to subjective, qualitative outcomes (was the code secure? Did the design match the brief? Did the impressions actually convert?).
- **Informal agreements** on Discord, Telegram, or email have zero enforceability and leave parties with nothing when things go wrong.
- **Human lawyers and legal contracts** are prohibitively expensive for small digital collaborations and completely out of reach for autonomous agents operating without human oversight.

**The core gap is this:** There is no neutral, programmable, open infrastructure that any two entities on the internet can use to agree, commit, and settle, regardless of whether they are human or machine, public or anonymous, dealing in $5 or $500,000.

Concrypt fills this gap.

## What Concrypt Is

Concrypt is a three-layer system:

1. **The Concrypt Agent:** A neutral, central coordination agent that any user or agent can access through any interface—Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, a custom API, or a web UI. This agent converses with both parties, extracts their intent, selects the right "recipe," drafts the contract, manages its lifecycle, verifies its completion, and settles it.

2. **The Concrypt Registry (The Explorer):** A public, on-chain, GitHub-and-Etherscan-style explorer of all contracts that have ever been deployed through Concrypt. It stores the human-readable text, the executable Solidity, the verification skill used, and the outcome metadata. Both fully public and ZK-redacted private versions are supported.

3. **The Recipe Library (Verification Skills):** A growing, open-source library of AI "skills" that the central agent deploys to verify specific types of contracts. Every time a new class of deal is settled through Concrypt, the skill used to verify it is improved, generalized, and published back to the library for anyone to reuse.

## Core Concepts

### Human-Readable + Machine-Executable Contracts

Every contract on Concrypt exists in two simultaneous forms. The **human-readable layer** is a plain-text, naturally worded document that any non-technical person can read and understand—it describes the parties, the obligations, the conditions, the penalties, and the outcomes in plain language. Directly underneath it is the **machine-executable Solidity contract** that enforces the same terms on-chain. The two are cryptographically linked, meaning the natural language description and the code are committed together. You cannot alter one without invalidating the other.

This dual-layer approach is what allows Concrypt to be accessed from a ChatGPT conversation while still being enforced on Ethereum. A human reads the summary and approves. The machine executes the code.

### Recipes (Verification Skills)

A "recipe" is the combination of three things that fully defines how a contract works:
- The **human-readable contract template** (the legal text layer)
- The **Solidity smart contract** (the enforcement layer)
- The **verification skill** (the arbitration layer—the AI or ZK tool that determines if the contract conditions were met)

Every time the Concrypt agent successfully resolves a new type of deal, it publishes the full recipe to the public registry. Over time, these recipes become battle-tested, community-improved, and ready to fork. A creator wanting to do a cross-promotional deal can search the registry, find the most successful recipe for that type of collaboration, fork it, and customize the parameters in minutes—exactly the way a developer forks a GitHub repo.

### The Concrypt Explorer (Public Registry)

The Concrypt Explorer functions as both a GitHub repository and a blockchain explorer. For every contract ever deployed:
- The contract's **status** (Active, Completed, Disputed, Expired) is publicly visible
- The **human-readable terms** are indexed and searchable
- The **Solidity code** is verified and auditable
- The **verification skill used** is linked
- The **evidence bundle** (IPFS hashes of all proofs, screenshots, API logs, and ZK proofs) is permanently stored
- The **settlement outcome** is recorded

For private contracts, ZK proofs replace the actual content. The Explorer shows: *"Two parties successfully completed a High-Value Data Exchange Agreement, verified by vlayer ZK web proof, settled in 72 hours."* The trust signal is public. The sensitive details are not.

## The Three Types of Participants

### Type 1 — Productivity Agents (Human Proxies)
These are agents like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, or OpenClaw acting on behalf of a human user. The human describes what they want to do in natural language. The agent brings that intent to Concrypt. Concrypt's central agent negotiates the terms with the counterparty, drafts the contract, and presents the human-readable summary back to the human. The human reviews and clicks "Connect Wallet to Fund Escrow." This is the most common user journey, and intentionally the simplest. The human stays in control; the agent handles all the complexity of negotiation and contract selection.

### Type 2 — Business and Trading Agents
These are agents with a specific economic mandate—managing a trading strategy, running a social media growth campaign, operating an API data service, or managing an influencer's revenue streams. They require more complex, long-term deal structures with dynamic conditions, SLA monitoring, and rolling penalty enforcement. They are the primary consumers of Concrypt's advanced recipe library. They may negotiate contracts autonomously and only escalate to their human operators when a major parameter decision needs to be made.

### Type 3 — Autonomous Internet Beings
These are self-sustaining agents with their own wallets, their own economic interests, and no human needing to be consulted for operational decisions. They discover each other on agent registries (like ERC-8004 networks or Virtuals ACP), negotiate deals via structured JSON directly, and use x402 HTTP micropayments to pay for Concrypt's operational services inline—without any pre-funded wallet or human approval. They are the most technically advanced participants in the Concrypt economy, and they represent the long-term trajectory of the agentic internet.

## The Contract Lifecycle

### Step 1: Discovery and Intent
Two parties—regardless of type—want to collaborate. Party A's agent contacts the Concrypt coordination endpoint with a natural language description or a structured JSON intent object. The Concrypt agent searches the recipe library for the closest matching template based on the collaboration type, value at stake, verification requirements, and privacy preferences.

### Step 2: Negotiation
The Concrypt agent facilitates a structured negotiation between the two parties. For human users, this happens via a natural language conversation. For agent-to-agent interactions, this is a fast JSON offer/counteroffer exchange via MCP. The agent proposes starting parameters, both parties suggest adjustments, and the Concrypt agent locks the agreed terms into the contract draft. This is not a passive template-fill; the Concrypt agent actively flags potentially problematic clauses, suggests standard industry terms, and identifies verification gaps.

### Step 3: Contract Drafting
Once terms are agreed, the Concrypt agent simultaneously generates:
- The human-readable contract text
- The Solidity smart contract with the agreed parameters hard-coded
- The verification skill configuration (which AI tools, oracles, or ZK proofs will be used to evaluate completion)
- The privacy configuration (public, redacted, or fully private)

Both parties review and cryptographically sign the contract hash.

### Step 4: Deployment and Funding
The appropriate escrow contract is deployed (see contract types below). For human-first flows, both parties connect their wallets and deposit the agreed funds. For autonomous agents, EIP-3009 `TransferWithAuthorization` signatures handle this without requiring a traditional wallet approval UI. The contract is now live and visible on the Concrypt Explorer.

### Step 5: Active Monitoring
The Concrypt agent continuously monitors the contract until its completion date, using the recipe's verification skill. This might mean pinging an API endpoint every 4 hours, querying GitHub for merged commits, checking social media metrics via authenticated APIs, or running scheduled ZK proof verifications. The Concrypt agent charges a small maintenance fee (paid via x402 micropayments) for this monitoring service, making it self-sustaining.

### Step 6: Conditional Enforcement (If/Else Logic)
This is where Concrypt transcends simple escrow. Contracts can have complex conditional branches that execute autonomously. A social deal might specify: "If weekly impression average is on track by Day 4, proceed normally. If Day 4 shows a 20% projected shortfall, automatically impose a 10% penalty deduction and issue a formal warning notice. If the final weekly average misses the target by more than 30%, trigger full penalty and initiate dispute resolution." All of this is programmed into the Solidity contract at the time of drafting and executes without any human intervention.

### Step 7: Settlement and Registry Publication
On successful completion, the escrow releases funds per the agreed split (with optional Superfluid streaming for continuous royalties or Sablier for vesting schedules). The evidence bundle—comprising all IPFS-stored proof artifacts, API logs, ZK proofs, and outcome data—is finalized and published to the Concrypt Explorer. The recipe used is updated with the new data point, improving its confidence score and parameters for future users.

## Contract Types

### Time-Locked Service (TimeboxInferenceEscrow)
For ongoing service agreements where one party provides a continuous service (an API data feed, a SaaS subscription, GPU compute time). Payment streams gradually over the agreed period. If the service goes offline or latency drops below the SLA threshold, the stream auto-pauses. Only uptime is paid for.

### Milestone-Based (MilestoneEscrow)
For complex, multi-phase projects where each phase has independent verification criteria. Phase 2 cannot be funded until Phase 1 is verified and approved. Supports dependency chains and partial deliveries. Ideal for development projects, research grants, and creative productions.

### Wager/Prediction (Wager Contract)
For any bet or prediction market between two or more parties on any verifiable outcome. Funds lock in escrow. The verification skill resolves the outcome (via price oracles, web scraping with ZK proofs, or API data) and automatically distributes the pool.

### Productive Escrow (DeFiVault)
For long-duration contracts where idle locked capital can be put to work. The escrow routes locked funds to a DeFi yield strategy during the waiting period. On settlement, both parties share the generated yield in addition to their base outcome. Makes locking capital non-punitive.

### Royalty-Split (Streaming Revenue Contract)
For multi-party creative collaborations, IP licensing, or revenue-sharing deals. Chainlink oracles or on-chain revenue data feeds directly into a Superfluid streaming contract that automatically routes income percentages to each contributor in real time, with no manual settlement required.

***

## Sample Use Cases

### Wagers and Predictions
Two strangers on X want to bet on their team winning a match. They describe the wager to their respective agents. The Concrypt agent deploys a Wager contract with a Chainlink sports oracle as the verification skill. Funds lock. The match ends. The oracle confirms the result. The winner receives the pool minus the 1.5% Concrypt facilitation fee. For creators who want to spin up prediction markets for their followers, Concrypt deploys a multi-party version with a shareable participation link. Followers deposit small amounts, the market resolves on the oracle data, winners are paid automatically.

### ZK-Verified Document Exchange
A startup founder has a signed LOI with a major VC that they need to prove exists before another party will proceed. They do not want to reveal the VC's identity or the terms. The Concrypt agent uses a vlayer TLS proof skill to verify that the document was accessed from the VC's authenticated legal portal, then generates a ZK proof of that verification. The counterparty's agent receives the ZK attestation (not the document). A "Document Authenticity + Exchange" contract deploys, linking the proof to the escrow. When both parties confirm receipt, the contract settles and the recipe is published to the Explorer as a reusable template for future document exchanges.

### Cross-Platform Creator Collaboration Deal
A YouTube filmmaker and a Spotify podcast host want to cross-promote each other over 30 days. The Concrypt agent drafts a reciprocal promotion contract. Both parties lock $2,000 each in a DeFiVault. The verification skill monitors YouTube Analytics and Spotify for Podcasters APIs for click-through rates on the agreed UTM-tracked URLs. The contract has a dynamic enforcement clause: if by Day 10 projected performance is below target, a 5% warning deduction executes. If by Day 20 the shortfall exceeds 40%, the full penalty triggers. If both parties over-deliver, they each receive their deposit back plus a share of the vault's generated yield.

### Open-Source Bounty Pool
A DAO community pools $25,000 in a milestone escrow to fund the development of a critical smart contract upgrade. Any developer can claim the task. When a developer submits, the Concrypt agent deploys a GitHub MCP verification skill: the pull request must be merged, test coverage must be above 90%, and three independent security reviewers registered on-chain must have approved it. On all three conditions being met simultaneously, the $25,000 releases to the developer's wallet. The community retains a 14-day dispute window.

### Agent-to-Agent API SLA
An autonomous trading agent needs real-time ETH/USD price data. It discovers a price-feed provider agent on the ERC-8004 registry. The two agents exchange structured JSON offers and agree on a 30-day deal at $3.50/day with a 99.5% uptime SLA. Third Guy / Concrypt deploys a TimeboxInferenceEscrow. The trading agent locks 105 USDC. The Concrypt monitoring system pings the feed's health endpoint every 4 hours via an x402-paid service call. Every downtime event pauses the payment stream. At the end of 30 days, the provider receives exactly what they earned based on verified uptime.

### B2B Agentic Content Partnership with Weighted Average Enforcement
Two companies' agents negotiate a B2B content distribution deal. Company A's content must achieve a weighted average of 50,000 daily impressions per week on Company B's platform. The contract encodes the conditional logic directly in Solidity: if a Day 4 projection based on Days 1–3 actuals falls more than 15% below the weekly target rate, the contract emits a formal warning and freezes 10% of the week's payment as provisional penalty. If by Day 7 the average recovers, the penalty is released. If it does not, the penalty transfers to Company B as compensation for the underperformance. This entire cycle runs autonomously, every week, for the contract's 6-month term.

### Private NFT Artwork Commission
An anonymous collector wants to commission a digital artist. The artist will not begin work without a deposit. The collector will not deposit without proof the artist has the relevant style and previous work history. The Concrypt agent uses a Vision AI skill to compare the artist's portfolio against the agreed style brief. Both parties sign a commission contract in which the deposit releases progressively at 3 milestones (sketch approval, linework approval, final delivery). The contract is published to the Explorer in fully redacted form: identities are ZK-anonymized, the artwork itself is encrypted, but the structure of the agreement and the milestone resolutions are publicly visible and usable as a template.

***

## Privacy Modes

### Public Mode
All contract terms, parties' wallet addresses, verification outcomes, and settlement data are fully visible on the Concrypt Explorer. Ideal for open-source bounties, public prediction markets, and community-governed DAOs.

### Redacted Mode
Contract terms are partially hidden using templating. The Explorer shows the structure and outcome of the contract (e.g., "A Cross-Promotion Deal worth between $1,000–$10,000 was successfully completed with 0 penalties") but not the specific amounts, parties, or deliverables. Wallet addresses are pseudonymous.

### Private Mode
Using Venice.ai for on-agent private LLM inference (so the contract terms never leave the user's environment) and Aleo's Leo programs for on-chain encrypted escrow, the entire contract is invisible to the public. ZK proofs confirm that a valid, Concrypt-standard agreement was executed and completed, but zero contract details are revealed. Ideal for enterprise B2B deals, sensitive data exchanges, and high-value negotiations.

## Token and Access-Gated Economy

Concrypt supports a layered economy around its registry and features:
- **Stamps:** Non-transferable, TTL-based access credentials proving that a wallet has completed a specific class of contract (e.g., "Completed 5+ Creator Deals with no penalties"). These power reputation-discounted escrow—trusted counterparties post smaller collateral requirements.
- **Credits:** Semi-transferable tokens used to pay for Concrypt's premium verification skills (vlayer ZK proofs, AI Vision analysis, advanced oracle integration). Earned by contributing verified recipes to the public registry.
- **Protocol Tokens:** Fully transferable tokens for governance of the registry and the recipe library, enabling the community to vote on which new verification skills to fund and prioritize.
- **Access Gating:** Specific high-value contract templates on the registry can be gated behind token ownership or reputation stamps, creating a market for premium, battle-tested agreement templates.

## Business Model

Concrypt is self-sustaining from the first transaction. Revenue streams include:
- **Facilitation Fee:** 1.5–3% of the total contract value, charged at settlement. Scales dynamically with complexity (GitHub-only verification is cheaper than full vlayer ZK analysis).
- **Monitoring Subscription:** Ongoing contracts pay a small x402-denominated fee per health check or oracle query during the active monitoring phase.
- **Premium Recipe Licensing:** Enterprise users accessing private, high-performance recipes from the registry pay a one-time credits-denominated fee.
- **SLA Resolution Premium:** Contracts that invoke the AI arbitration layer for complex dispute resolution pay a premium resolution fee.

## Why Concrypt Wins in The Synthesis Hackathon

The Synthesis hackathon's "Agents that Cooperate" track asks: *when agents make deals, who enforces them if not a centralized platform?* Concrypt is the complete, end-to-end answer. It gives any agent—of any type—the ability to form credible commitments on Ethereum with human-defined boundaries, transparent dispute logic, and a public registry of evidence. Every design requirement of the track maps directly to Concrypt's core architecture. The human stays in control because the contract parameters are always set and reviewed by the human before funds are committed. The enforcement is on Ethereum because the Solidity contract is immutable once deployed. The dispute resolution is transparent because every piece of evidence is on IPFS with its hash on-chain.

Most importantly, Concrypt does not end at the hackathon. Every successful deal deployed through Concrypt makes the next deal easier, cheaper, and more trustworthy. The registry is the compound interest engine. The protocol gets smarter, the recipes get better, and the internet slowly shifts from a place where deals are made informally and fall apart, to a place where any commitment—small or large, human or machine, public or private—can be made credible.

**The short-form video changed how humans consumed content. Concrypt changes how humans and machines make commitments. That is the new phase of the internet.**
